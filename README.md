# AI Business Analysis in AI Transformation

## Why this repository exists
Companies adopt AI faster than they understand how to use it.
This repository shows how a Business Analyst enables successful AI adoption
by translating business problems into AI-ready requirements.

## My role as an AI Business Analyst / Product Manager 
I work at the intersection of:
- Business goals and constraints
- Data availability and quality
- AI capabilities and limitations
- Risk, compliance, and human decision-making

## What I focus on (not generic AI expertise)
- Identifying AI-suitable business problems
- Defining AI-specific requirements and acceptance criteria
- Assessing data readiness and bias risks
- Designing human-in-the-loop workflows
- Managing expectations and AI-related risks

## What this repository contains
This repository will gradually include:
- AI problem framing checklists
- Business-to-AI canvases
- AI requirements templates
- Human-AI decision flow examples
- Practical case studies (realistic and hypothetical)

## What this repository is NOT
- Machine learning tutorials
- Prompt engineering experiments
- Model training or optimization
